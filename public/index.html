        <h1>Getting Started</h1>

        <div class="challenge">
            <h2>Setup</h2>
            <p>You'll need to open a terminal, change directory into the may-challenges directory and run <code>npm install</code> </p>
            <p>Once that has completed you'll need to then run <code>node server.js</code> in order to start serving the assets.</p>
            <p>Everything inside the public folder will be served on http://localhost:8080.</p>
            <p><strong>Before beginning work, create and checkout a new Git branch "challenges" and after every challenge you should commit your work to this branch.</strong></p>
        </div>

        <div class="challenge">
            <h2>Tools provided</h2>
            <p>You've been provided with a basic CSS framework. It doesn't do much, but what it does do is documented at the link below.</p>
            <p>For the later challenges, there is also an api provided.</p>
            <p><a href="docs.html">See the docs</a></p>

        <h1>Challenges</h1>

        <div class="challenge">
            <h2>HTML Challenge</h2>
            <p>The challenge is to create a document using HTML. This document should be a recipe for a food or drink you enjoy.</p>
            <p>Your document should be valid, semantic HTML5, which will also work with screen reading software. You should also ensure that your HTML is structured in such a way that the document information flows sensibly.</p>
            <p>An empty file <code>challenge.html</code> has been provided in the public folder, and you should put all code here.</p>
            <p>You should write no CSS of your own, but instead your document should include the stylesheet <code>base.css</code> found in the public folder. This will provide a very simple framework for laying out your page.</p>
            <p>Your document should include at least the following element types, but can contain any extra you require.</p>
            <ul>
                <li>paragraphs</li>
                <li>tables</li>
                <li>image tag</li>
                <li>classes</li>
                <li>list</li>
            </ul>
            <p>
                <a href="challenge.html">Your HTML Challenge</a>
            </p>
        </div>

        <div class="challenge">
            <h2>CSS Challenge</h2>
            <p>Now that you have a valid html document, you should go back to it and modify it to include the empty stylesheet <code>challenge.css</code>. <strong>This is the only change you should make to your HTML.</strong></p>
            <p>All edits should now be in the CSS only.</p>
            <p>You will be given a design for your recipe which you are to implement. This design will be intended to cover:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>The CSS Box model</li>
                <li>Positioning attributes</li>
                <li>background images</li>
                <li>Pseudo selectors and pseudo elements</li>
            </ul>
            <p>

        <div class="challenge">
            <h2>JS Challenge</h2>

            <p>Congratulations! Your recipe is a huge success! The content and design are so good that you've gone viral. Your employer would now like to capitalise on that traffic by capturing as many visitors as possible into a signup form.</p>
            <p>The backend team have made new server endpoints for you, at <code>/analytics</code> and <code>/newsletter</code>. You need to capture peoples name and email address and POST it to this new service.</p>
            <p>You've been tasked to complete the following steps, <strong>at the end of each step you must commit your work.</strong></p>
            <ol>
                <li>Using jquery, on page load send a POST request to <code>/analytics</code> including the URL of the page.</li>
                <li>Hardcode a new modal that sits over the existing content and has fields for name and email, as well as a submit button.</li>
                <li>Use jQuery to submit those details to the <code>/newsletter</code> endpoint on click of the button</li>
                <li>When the details have been submitted, close the modal and allow access to the content behind.</li>
            </ol>
